# Google-Trends-Data-analysis
Analyze how google search terms tell us about the world
We will investigate how:
<ul>
  <li>How search volume of "Bitcoin" relates to the price of Bitcoin</li>
  <li>How search volume for a hot stock like Tesla relates to that stock's price</li>
  <li>How searches for "Unemployment Benefits" vary with the actual unemployment rate in the U.S</li>
</ul>
